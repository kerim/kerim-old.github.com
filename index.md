### Latest News

From February 2021 till the end of January 2022 I have received the [Professorial Fellowship for the Chair of Taiwan Studies at Leiden University](https://www.iias.asia/professorial-fellowship-chair-taiwan-studies-leiden-university), where I will be teaching one course per a semester. Because of COVID-19, I am currently still in Taiwan, teaching online, but I hope to make it to Leiden for the second semester if things improve.
