        <p>[Excerpt ] From its founding, it became clear that Savage Minds filled an important niche, quickly drawing the attention of others in the academic blogosphere.<!-- more here -->In 2006 Nature ranked Savage Minds 17th out of the 50 top science blogs across all scientific disciplines (Nature.com 2006). In 2010, American Anthropologist has called Savage Minds “the central online site of the North American anthropological community” whose “value is found in the quality of the posts by the site’s central contributors, a cadre of bright, engaged, young anthropology professors” (Price 2010:141). Through an analysis of our own involvement as co-founders and editors of Savage Minds this chapter seeks to explore the reasons for our blog’s success, not for the purpose of self-aggrandizement, but to better understand the as-yet-unfulfilled promise of online scholarly communication in anthropology for which Savage Minds constitutes an initial public beta. To the extent our site is a successful example of public scholarship, it is so (we will argue) because of the way it straddles, engages with, and transforms two key spaces of discourse: anthropology’s ‘professional imaginary’ and ‘public anthropology.’ We argue that the goal of public anthropology is best served by the blog when it takes the form of “doing anthropology in public”—embodying the professional imaginary on a public platform. </p>

“[Collaboration against ethnography: How colonial history shaped the making of an ethnographic film](https://www.academia.edu/3648076/Collaboration_against_ethnography_How_colonial_history_shaped_the_making_of_an_ethnographic_film).” *[Critique of Anthropology](http://coa.sagepub.com/content/33/4/390.short)*. December 2013. (SSCI)
> What happens when a commitment to collaborative ethnographic filmmaking runs up against a community’s ambivalence towards its own history? This paper provides an ethnohistorical account of the making of the film Please Don’t Beat Me, Sir!, exploring how colonial-era “police ethnographies” and contemporary communal politics shape the collaborative endeavor. The film was made in collaboration with Budhan Theatre, an activist theater troupe from the Chhara community in the Indian city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The Chhara are one of more than 198 communities labeled as “Criminal Tribes” by the British, a colonial legacy that still informs their interactions with the police. Inspired by the work of Jean Rouch, the film makes use of experimental ethnographic and cinematic techniques. These participation frameworks allowed the members of Budhan Theatre and their families to shape the structure and content of the film itself, a process sometimes at odds with the film’s ethnographic intent.

“[From Thugs to Victims: Dakxin Bajrange Chhara’s Cinema of Justice](https://www.academia.edu/806631/From_Thugs_to_Victims_Dakxin_Bajrange_Chharas_Cinema_of_Justice).” *[Visual Anthropology](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08949468.2011.583571)* Vol. 24, No. 4. September 2011.
> The documentary films of Indian filmmaker Dakxin Bajrange Chhara focus, not on his own community, but on marginalized nomadic communities within his home state of Gujarat. In order to understand these films I draw on Partha Chatterjee's theory of "political society" to argue that Bajrange's portrayal of the social injustices directed against these other communities serves also to challenge the historical stigma his own community feels as a result of having been labeled a "Criminal Tribe" by the British. By highlighting the victimhood of India’s Denotified and Nomadic Tribes (DNTs), Bajrange seeks to embue them with the “moral attributes of a community.”

“[Aborigine Education Policy Under the Japanese](https://www.academia.edu/806632/Entering_the_Mountains_to_Rule_the_Aborigines_Taiwanese_Aborigine_Education_and_the_Colonial_Encounter).” Chapter in volume, *[Becoming Taiwan, from Colonialism to Democracy](http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3880.ahtml)*. Edited by Ann Heylen and Scott Sommers. Harrassowitz-Verlag. 2010.
> Just as Native American education policy in post-Civil War United States was shaped by the thirst for land during a period of rapid westward expansion, so too was Aborigine education policy in Taiwan shaped by the forces which drew first the Qing, and later the Japanese into the rugged terrain of the high Central Mountain Range and the remote plains of the East Coast. Education policy was central to U.S. territorial expansion because "the willingness of Indians to sell their land" was assumed to be "directly proportionate to their ability to acquire civilized ways" (Adams 1988: 16). Whereas in the U.S. case these "civilized ways" were defined in terms Protestant ideology and an agricultural lifestyle, during the late Qing dynasty Confucianism and wet paddy rice farming served a similar purpose. The civilizing mission was no less central during Japanese rule, although loyalty to the Emperor replaced Confucianism. While the civilizing mission remained constant throughout the entire period, spanning from 1874 to 1945, there were important differences in implementation which had profound effects on the incorporation of Aborigines into the state. The arrival of the Colonial Japanese Government in 1895 marked an important turning point, bringing a new urgency to the task of occupying the mountain territories. And the start of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937 crated a need for loyal subjects willing to die for the Emperor. Taiwan's unique geography mattered too, with education policies in the Central Range differing from those on the East Coast. Accordingly, this chapter is organized around three time periods: late Qing (1874-1945), prewar (1895-1937) and wartime Japanese rule (1937-1945), with differences in education policy between the Mountains and the East Coast highlighted whenever possible.

"[Ethical Hegemony](https://www.academia.edu/806628/Ethical_Hegemony)." In *[Rethinking Marxism](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08935690902955062)*, July 2009.
> Drawing upon Peter Ives's book Gramsci's Politics of Language, this article examines the linguistic origins of Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony. This is then compared with Pierre Bourdieu's theory of the habitus, with a particular focus on how the two theories conceptualize social change. Ives shows that Gramsci understood language standardization as either democratic or repressive, depending on the nature of the standardization process. Ives uses this to argue that the opposite of repressive hegemony is not the absence of hegemony but a progressive hegemony grounded in democratic processes. While Bourdieu's emphasis on social reproduction over social change makes his work less useful for conceptualizing such a progressive hegemony, this paper argues that his theory of symbolic capital (including linguistic capital) offers us a unique insight into the obstacles faced by agents of progressive social change and, in so doing, sheds light on the limitations of Gramsci's approach.
